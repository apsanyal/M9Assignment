# M9Assignment
Hello Zak,

I went about this assignment in my own way.  I was not able to follow the assignment instructions. The prebuilt application was difficult for me to navigate. So I broke this problem down into pieces in order to get the data to go into the table. I talk more about my process in my discussion post. My application does work- it is able to pull the data from the json file into the table using async/await.

Thank you,
AP
